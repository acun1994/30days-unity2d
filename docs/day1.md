# Day 1 Content

Today I focused on following the first [interactive tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/interactive-tutorials/play-edit-mode?playlist=49382)
provided by Unity

## Tutorial 1.1

### Basic Editor Controls and an Introduction to Scenes and Play

**Scenes** represent the overall state of the game, including loaded assets.

The **Play window** on the other hand is the view shown to the player itself, and is controlled by a **GameCamera**.

## Tutorial 1.2

### Introduction to Scene Manipulation

**GameObjects** in the **Scene** can be manipulated either by selecting them in the **Scene** window itself, or from the **Hierarchy window** (a list of all objects in the scene). The **Inspector window** is then used to view and modify the **GameObjects** basic properties or add/remove Compenents.

### Introduction to Basic Components

Unity uses **GameObjects** to represent all objects in a game. However, **GameObjects** by themselves do not do anything. Instead, we have to add Components to **GameObjects** to determine their behaviour. This includes stuff like **Colliders**, Physics, AI and Player Controls.
